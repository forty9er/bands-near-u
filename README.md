# A Music/Location Discovery Application

![Screenshot10](docs/screenshots/screenshot10.png)

This web app was written by a team of 4 Makers Academy students for our final project.
The app is designed to help the user discover music from artists based in their current location or any location of their choice, and to find music performed in that location.
Alternatively, it could be used to understand a bit more about a location via the music that is produced or performed there. 
The local artists found can be filtered by their worldwide popularity. 


## Live demo

## Duration
9 days


## Approach
We proceeded to build this app using the Agile methodologies we practise at Makers Academy. Twice (or three times) daily stand-ups, twice weekly retros and pair programming, rotating pairs twice a day. This way each one of us had some input in every facet of the app and we had a good understanding of what we were each doing at any given time.

As the application is location-based it was important to implement a responsively-designed UI. For this we used Bootstrap, re-organising the elements for smaller screens and hiding the brand name to make more room for the search bar (the brand logo remains in either case).
